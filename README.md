# Alien_attack
A game made using Python and pygame. Player controls a ship that shoots aliens. It includes a high score display, current score display, 
level display, and number of lives left in each play of the game. This project served as a way for me to practice gain more experience with
the Python programming language and have some more mastery over it. Learned how to use other modules in my work and the importance of 
refactoring code for better readability.
